Task 1: Python Task

Objective: Assess the candidate's Python programming skills, including problem-solving, code readability, and use of libraries.

Problem: Analyze a dataset and generate insights

  Download the Iris dataset.

  url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"

Write a Python script that:

  Loads the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
  Performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:
  Summary statistics for each feature (mean, median, standard deviation).

  The count of unique values in the "species" column.
  Generates a histogram for one numeric feature and a scatter plot comparing two features.

  Identifies and handles any missing values in the dataset (even if simulated by altering the dataset).

  Implements a simple classification model using logistic regression from Scikit-learn:

  Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  Trains the model and evaluates it using accuracy.

Deliverable:

  Python script (.py or .ipynb).
  Charts embedded as part of the code output.

Evaluation Criteria:

  Code structure and readability.
  Correct implementation of EDA, plots, and handling missing data.
  Basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
